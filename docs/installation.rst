Installation
============

We recommend running `containerized versions`_ of ``meica`` to avoid dependency issues.
The `Docker Engine`_ appropriate for your system (i.e., linux, Mac OSX, or Windows) is required to access and run the container.

.. _Docker Engine: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

It is also possible to run "bare-metal" ``meica`` if your system has `AFNI`_ and python 2.7 or 3.4+ installed.
With a local python installation, we recommend using the `Anaconda`_ or `Miniconda`_ package manager, as these allow for the creation of `virtual environments`_.
